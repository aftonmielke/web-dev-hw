# My Intro-Web-Dev-Homework Repo
## Afton Mielke

I carry an interest in having a background in some web-development to give my art degree a bit more substance </p>

In the module "What is the internet, really?" I learned

- The internet can be related to light
- The application of the internet is an extremely physical process
- When broken, the cables of the internet must be physically reconnected using ships and divers.
