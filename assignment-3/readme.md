The **body** of the page holds the content of the site, including whatever the page host wishes to say. The **head** *is not visible to the viewer*, whereas the **body** *is visible to the viewer*

### Work Cycle
  #### My Failures
  - I spent fifteen minutes trying to figure out why my relative URL wasn't working. It was because I needed another .
  - I couldn't remember how to get a link with a visible hyperlink, I included  ```<a href="___"/a>``` with a the URL's name included.
  - I realized I'd been a little impatient when it came to waiting for updates to the github server.
  - I couldn't get the beetcake image to post!
  #### My Successes
  - I felt as though I had a pretty good hold on this assignment and what it was asking of me.
  - I was able to give emphasis, italicize, cite and define on my first push to github every time.
  - I was able to troublshoot all my issues without even yelling or crying.
  - I didn't have to rage quit.
  -I discovered command+/ puts the line into a comment! Neat!
