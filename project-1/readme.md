# Part 3: Project 1 Technical Report

### Brief Summary of how Browsers Function
To browse the web, I use Google Chrome. The user interface is presented to the user to interact with. A browser has a rendering engine, it constructs the page by interpreting HTML and CSS and displaying the content. The browser communicates over the network, asking for necessary images and documents that make up the page.
### The Wayback Machine
On the Wayback machine, I went to google.com, as it was the only site I could think of that's been around for more than eighteen years. The website snapshot was incredibly basic, using a simple image for the Google Doodle, as well as a displayed invitation to get google monthly updates emailed to you--something Google no longer offers.

### Work Cycle
#### What I Learned
- How to prepare a webpage to be displayed as a webpage
- How to write elements of HTML documents
- What a root, head, and body element is, and how to begin and end each element
- The differences between an HTML language and markup language

#### My Failures and Successes
- I struggled at the beginning with preparing the page with the <!DOCTYPE > Element, it caused quite a bit of frustration
- I discovered the importance of adding an end element, and how it affects the entire rest of the page
- I had to rage quit. Twice.
- I'm grateful I kept all my push comments... *appropriate*
