In order to send data over the internet, your computer must **translate the alphabetic text to an electronic signal**, then back to an alphabetic text. This is translated **via a protocol stack**. In each step, the data is broken down into smaller bits of information called **packets**. Then these packets are asigned a **port number** in order to be received by the destination computer. The packets then receive its **destination IP**, where it's then translated to **electronic signals via the computer's hardware**. The destination computer's **router**, which then **sends it to the correct IP address**, where the computer then **translates the electronic signals to alphabetic text in the reverse order they were sent**.

An **IP Address** is an address assigned to a computer as identification. Similar to a social security number. A **DNS** is a **Domain Name Service** is a mechanism to translate IP addresses to a domain, as well as translate domains into IP addresses, like having your name associated to your Social Security Number, and vice versa.
