# Assignment 5 Technical Report
## Afton Mielke

### Identifying differences
#### Div
The **div** tag separates the page and its specific parts into manageable, easily distinguishable parts.
#### Classes
The **class* tag identifies specific parts of the page into a class, giving it the flexibility to be styled a specific way, sorted meaningfully, and grouped with similar attributes.
#### IDs
The **ID** tag is a unique name attributed to a specific piece of a page, giving it a name, purpose, and easily distinguishable tag.
####Span
The **span** tag provides a referene to styling code and give information about the inner content.

### Why Third Party Media?
Media from a third party allows servers to be less bogged down by the size of a video that would otherwise be directly uploaded. A third party tag allows the page to reference a piece of media that may be larger than the server can manage specifically, but allows the third party to hold responsibility for hosting the media.

###Work Cycle
#### What I Learned
- I learned how to embed media
- I learned the value of dividing your page up into manageable blocks
- I learned how to manage media into specific areas and easy-to-find spots.
- I learned the value of embedding media from a third party, as opposed to hosting the media yourself.

### My Failures and Successes
- I realized what style attributes apply where
- I didn't understand how to give my lyrics line breaks until I remembered to add a line break.
- I didn't necessarily struggle too hard with any part of this assignment. I was able to troubleshoot and identify my problems quickly and efficiently.
- I still struggle a little with relative URLS.
