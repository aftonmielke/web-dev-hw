      <h4> Lyrics <h4>
      <p>
          Well grey clouds wrapped round the town like elastic </br>
          Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic </br>
          The boy laughed at the spastic dancing around in the rain </br>
          While laundrettes cleaned clothes, high heels rub toes </br>
          Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows </br>
          Dressed in their suits and their boots well they all look the same </br>
      </p>

      <p>
          I took myself down to the cafe to find all the boys lost in books and crackling vinyl </br>
          And carved out a poem above the urinal that read </br>
          Don't you cry for the lost </br>
          Smile for the living </br>
          Get what you need and give what you're given </br>
          Life's for the living so live it </br>
          Or you're better off dead </br>
      </p>

      <p>
          While the evening pulled the moon out of it's packet </br>
          Stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket </br>
          We needed a nail but we tacked it 'til it fell of the wall </br>
      </p>

      <p>
          While pigeons pecked trains, sparks flew like planes </br>
          The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains </br>
          And we all had new iPhones, but no one had no one to call </br>
      </p>

      <p>
          I stumbled my way down to the stomach of the town </br>
          Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown </br>
          With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said, </br>
          "Don't you cry for the lost </br>
          Smile for the living </br>
          Get what you need, and give what you're given </br>
          Life's for the living; so live it </br>
          Or you're better off dead" </br>
      </p>

      <p>
          Well I'm sick of this town, this blind man's forage </br>
          They take your dreams down and stick them in storage </br>
          You can have them back, son, when you've paid off your mortgage and loans </br>
          Oh, hell with this place, I'll go it my own way</br>
          I'll stick out my thumb and I'll trudge down the highway</br>
          Someday, someone must be going my way home</br>
      </p>

      <p>
          Till then I'll make my bed from a disused car</br>
          With a mattress of leaves and a blanket of stars</br>
          And I'll stitch the words into my heart with a needle and thread</br>
          Don't you cry for the lost</br>
          Smile for the living</br>
          Get what you need, and give what you're given</br>
          You know life's for the living so live it</br>
          Or you're better off dead</br>

          Don't you cry for the lost </br>
          Smile for the living </br>
          Get what you need, and give what you're given </br>
          Life's for the living so live it </br>
          Or you're better off dead </br>
      </p>
