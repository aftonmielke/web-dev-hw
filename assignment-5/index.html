      <h4> Lyrics <h4>
      <p>
          Well grey clouds wrapped round the town like elastic
          Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic
          The boy laughed at the spastic dancing around in the rain
          While laundrettes cleaned clothes, high heels rub toes
          Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
          Dressed in their suits and their boots well they all look the same

          I took myself down to the cafe to find all the boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
          And carved out a poem above the urinal that read
          Don't you cry for the lost
          Smile for the living
          Get what you need and give what you're given
          Life's for the living so live it
          Or you're better off dead

          While the evening pulled the moon out of it's packet
          Stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket
          We needed a nail but we tacked it 'til it fell of the wall

          While pigeon's pecked trains, sparks flew like planes
          The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
          And we all had new iPhones but no one had no one to call

          And I stumbled down to the stomach of the town
          Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown
          With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said
          Don't you cry for the lost
          Smile for the living
          Get what you need and give what you're given
          Life's for the living so live it
          Or you're better off dead

          Well I'm sick of this town, this blind man's forage
          They take your dreams down and stick them in storage
          You can have them back son when you've paid off your mortgage and loans
          Oh hell with this place, I'll go it my own way
          I'll stick out my thumb and I trudge down the highway
          Someday someone must be going my way home

          Till then I'll make my bed from a disused car
          With a mattress of leaves and a blanket of stars
          And I'll stitch the words into my heart with a needle and thread
          Don't you cry for the lost
          Smile for the living
          Get what you need and give what you're given
          You know life's for the living so live it
          Or you're better off dead

          Don't you cry for the lost
          Smile for the living
          Get what you need and give what you're given
          Life's for the living so live it
          Or you're better off dead
        </p>
