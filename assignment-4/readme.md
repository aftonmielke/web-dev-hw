### What is Alternative Text?
#### and why do we use it?
  <p> Alternative text is an attribute attached to a given HTML code in order to describe to the page the purpose and contents of that specific code. Alternative text is especially useful **in an instance where the attached photo doesn't load**. It **gives the user a descriptive explanation of what the image would have contributed to the page**. It also attaches a tag to your image, which **allows the image to be found on search engines via the alternative text**. It also **allows those taking advantage of screen readers** to fully experience and be a part of your page.

### Forms I've Come Across
Wells Fargo's finance transfer form is one I use on a regular basis. It includes a drop-down menu, a text box, and a required input.

### Work Cycle
#### My Failures
  - I had a really hard time figuring out how the table I added to the page was supposed to be formatted, the instructions said that all the information I was given was to be attributed to either a column heading or a row heading.
  - I kept adding superfluous information to my table, including extra paragraph breaks, and table row beginning and ends
  - I didn't remember how to use autofocus
#### My Successes
  - Thankfully I'm getting much more comfortable with coding
  - I understand attributes very thoroughly, after having to type them again and again!
  - I was able to completely finish the assignment without rage-quitting!
