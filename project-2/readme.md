# Instructables Markdown
## Recap in HTML
### The good, the bad, the interesting.
- I really enjoyed being able to write code and know what it's affecting and how it's making things different on my page.
- I really enjoy watching the changes I make introduce themselves into the page and become interactive
- I struggled a lot with the table on my first page, but after about a jillion edits I was able to finally tackle it down and understand how my edits were affecting the table.

## CSS Excitables
- I'm excited for things to start looking like they've finally stepped out of the 90's.
- I'm excited for interactive buttons and aesthetically pleasing buttons, colors, codes, fonts, and styles!

## Work Cycle
### What I Learned
- I'm getting more comfortable with the "command=name"--thing.
- I was able to start fluidly writing code while knowing what it meant and was doing.
- I learned what happens when you try to double-up code and it goes down.

### My Struggles
- That table, though.
- Seriously. Everything else went pretty well. The table.
